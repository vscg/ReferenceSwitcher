This is a visual studio extension that switches projects reference to file references (and vice versa) when a project is added or removed from the solution

I only made it compatibility for VS2017 also. 

The work was done by Mark Kemper: https://github.com/markkemper1/ReferenceSwitcher and https://github.com/haydenmeade/ReferenceSwitcher
